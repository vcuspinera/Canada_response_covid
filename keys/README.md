# Keys
To use the twitter API you would need to apply for a [Twitter's developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).

If you don't know where to start or what you should write in your request to get your Twitter developer account, I recomend to look these resources:
- [Twitter API Data Collection](https://youtu.be/Jl-_dDqSaUQ?t=59) by Stevesie Data, see from 0:59 to 1:44 minute.
- [Example of the Twitter Developer Account Application Process](https://wptweetboost.com/example-of-the-twitter-developer-account-application-process/) by Hudson Atwell.

After your developer account application gets approved, you will find your authenication keys in [this link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps), where you will find your keys: `API key`, `API secret key`, `Access token` and `Access token secret`.

For this project I used my personal Twitter's keys; however, if you want to use these code, you will need to clone the repo and add your authentication keys in [the `twitter_config.py` file](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/blob/master/keys/twitter_config.py) to run the scripts.
