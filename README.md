# People's perception of Canadian Government
### **i'm lovin' or hatin' it!**
*Sentiment analysis of people's tweets refeering to Canadian Government's official accounts.*

### Introduction
The idea of this project was born after March 27th, 2020, when the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, [announced a series of policies facing impacts of Covid-19](https://youtu.be/1o-tV0A87l8) to support small businesses and their employees.  

This made me define the initial objective of this project to analyse the Canadian government's response to Covid-19 through making sentiment analysis on people's tweets mentioning some Canadian Government's official accounts ([@CanadianPM](https://twitter.com/CanadianPM), [@Canada](https://twitter.com/canada?lang=en), [@GovCanHealth](https://twitter.com/govcanhealth?lang=en) and [@OpenGovCan](https://twitter.com/OpenGovCan)).

Considering that Trudeau's announcement was done on March 27th, I was willing to get tweets from March 1st until April 30th, to look for messages before and after the announcement and compare how much the sentiment of people changed over this period.

However, the standard twitter developer's account only gives access to search historic databases with a 7-day limit, which means that I was not able to find tweets for a date older than one week. This restriction made me relax the objective of this project, evolving to a more general version looking for the perception of people about Canadian Government in the available time.
