## Overview
The idea of this project was born after March 27th, 2020, when the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, [announced a series of policies facing impacts of Covid-19](https://youtu.be/1o-tV0A87l8) to support small businesses and their employees.  

The objective of this project is to analyse the Canadian Government response to Covid-19 through the precepetion of the people by making sentiment analysis on people's tweets mentioning Canadian Government's accounts as [@JustinTrudeau](https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?s=20), [@CanadianPM](https://twitter.com/CanadianPM), [@Canada](https://twitter.com/canada?lang=en) and [@GovCanHealth](https://twitter.com/govcanhealth?lang=en).


## Retrieving tweets
To compare the tweets before and after Trudeau announcement, the first step was getting the tweets from March 1st to April 30th, from the four official-accounts selected from the Government of Canada.

Our first attempt was using the [Twitter API](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/blob/master/src/twitter-search_v1_TwitterAPI.ipynb). For this reason we get a twitter developer's account<sup><a name="myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. However, the standard twitter developer's account only gives access to search historic databases with a 7-day limit, which means that I was not able to find tweets for a date older than one week, so this approach was not useful for the objective of our project.

For our second approach we used the [GetOldTweets3 library](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/blob/master/src/twitter-search_v2_GetOldTweets3.ipynb). This innitially worked, however due the changes in Twitter's API in late 2020, GetOldTweets3 is not longer functioning.

The final (and succesful) approach to get the wanted tweets was using the [snscrape package](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/blob/master/src/twitter-search_v3_snscrape.ipynb). This package allowed us to find old tweets as opposed to the free version of the API from twitter, and the GetOldTweets3 library that is non-currently working.

With the snscrape package we download a maximum of 100,000 tweets saving them in one file per each day for each account. This means that we got 244 `JSON` files, storaging them in the [_tweets_ folder of this repository](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/tree/master/tweets).

Subsequently, we merged some selected columns of these files in one file named _tweets_db.json_.

Our final step of this section was [preprocessing the tweets](https://github.com/vcuspinera/Canada_response_covid/blob/master/src/preprocess.py) to delete some of the sensible information as emails and urls.<sup><a name="myfootnote2">2</a></sup> You can run the preprocess.py script by writing in the Terminal at the main folder of this repository:

```
python src/preprocess.py --input_dir=tweets/ --output_dir=tweets/
```
