# Sentiment analysis of tweets by people directed to Canadian Government's accounts

### Introduction
The idea of this project was born after last March 27th, 2020, when the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, [announced a series of policies facing impacts of Covid-19]((https://youtu.be/1o-tV0A87l8)).  

This made me define the initial objective of this project to analyse the Canadian government's response to Covid-19 through making sentiment analysis on tweets from the people directed to Government's twitter accounts ([@CanadianPM](https://twitter.com/CanadianPM), [@Canada](https://twitter.com/canada?lang=en), [@GovCanHealth](https://twitter.com/govcanhealth?lang=en) and [@OpenGovCan](https://twitter.com/OpenGovCan)).

Considering that Trudeau's announcement was done on March 27th, I was willing to get tweets from March 1st until April 30th, to look for tweets before and after the announcement and compare how much the messages change from in this time.

However, the standard twitter developer's account only gives access to search historic databases with a 7-day limit, which means that I was not able to find tweets for a date older than one week. This restriction made me relax the objective of this project, to make sentiment analysis on tweets directed to the Government of Canada in the available period.
