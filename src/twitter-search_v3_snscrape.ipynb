    "The aim of this notebook is to retrieve the tweets from March 1st until April 30th, to analyze the difference in sentiment analysis of tweets from people before and after Trudeau's [announcement of government policies facing impact of Covid-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o-tV0A87l8&feature=youtu.be) to support small businesses and their employees.\n",

    "The **snscrape** allowed us to find old tweets (as opposed to the free version of the API from twitter, and the GetOldTweets3 library that is non-currently working). The way to download tweets with this library is well explained in Martin Beck's article _[How to Scrape Tweets With snscrape](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-scrape-tweets-with-snscrape-90124ed006af)_ at Medium.\n",
